Export all your installed extensions
	First export all of your installed extensions into a text file (amend the output path as you see fit)

	codium --list-extensions | tee ~/vscode-extensions.txt

	This will output all of your extensions to ~/vscode-extensions.txt and list them out in your terminal for you to see.
	Save this file in system-config

Export your settings
	Export any custom keybindings and user settings you have as default.
	cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json ~/vscode-settings.json

	cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/keybindings.json ~/vscode-keybindings.json

Reinstall your extensions for VSCodium
	Because VSCodium has the same command line tools, we invoke them the same was as before

	xargs -n1 code --install-extension < ~/vscode-extensions.txt

	This went through the file and executed code --install-extension on each line individually.
	You should have seen the output in your terminal.
	If you get a DeprecationWarning: Buffer()... warning, you don't need to worry, it's related to Yarn and can be resolved with yarn global add yarn
